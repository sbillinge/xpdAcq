Cheat Sheet
===========

Please use this page as a reminder and to copy  and paste code snippets into your ``collection``
and ``analysis-dev`` ipython terminals.

To understand in more detail what the code does, please go to :ref:`xpdu`

Start a beamtime
----------------

1. run ``icollection`` to start a collection ipython environment
2. run the end-beamtime sequence if it has not been run 

.. code-block:: python

  _end_beamtime()

3. run the start-beamtime sequence

.. code-block:: python

  bt = _start_beamtime(PI_last=<last_name_of_pi_on_the_SAF>, saf_num=<saf_number>,
                       experimenters = ['Emma', 'Watson', 'Tim', 'Liu'],
                       wavelength=0.184649)

4. link bt to xrun

.. code-block:: python

  xrun.beamtime = bt

5. Copy the Excel spreadsheet provided by the experimenters with their samples in it to the ``xpdUser/import`` directory. Check that it has the name ``<saf_number>_samples.xlsx``
where the <saf_number> must match that of the current beamtime.  If the user didn't supply such a thing, then copy the file ``300000_samples.xls`` from the ``xpdConfig`` directory
(which is at the same level of the directory tree as the ``xpdUser`` directory) to ``xpdUser/import`` and edit the filename so that it has the ``saf_number`` of the current beamtime.

6. load the info in the spreadsheet by typing:

.. code-block:: python

  import_sample_info()

.. Note::

  The sample objects may be updated at any time by editing the spreadsheet in the ``xpdUser/import`` directory
  and rerunning ``import_sample_info()``. Objects are `overwritten`, so it is recommended to edit and/or add
  samples to the spreadsheet but not to delete old sample info unless it is not wanted.
  
8. calibrate the wavelength.

   FIXME
   
9. load the wavelength by typing:

.. code-block:: python

  bt.wavelength = <value of wavelength in angstroms>


Things should now be set up for the user to run the experiment.  Information about this is in
the main part of the documentation.

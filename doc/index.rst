xpdAcq documentation
====================

Introduction
++++++++++++

To post questions about anything XPD, including software, and to see archived answers, please join the `XPD-Users Google group 
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/xpd-users;context-place=overview>`_

``xpdAcq`` is a Python package that aids data collection at the XPD beamlime. It is built on top of and augments the NSLS-II data acquisition Python
package `bluesky <http://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/>`_ .

XPD may be operated directly by bluesky, or using xpdAcq.

The goal of the ``xpdAcq`` package is to simplify your collection and analysis workflow during beamtime,
so that you can focus more on scientific aspects of your experiment. Additionally, ``xpdAcq`` provides an interface 
that needs less Python experience than the current native bluesky interface.

We hope that you find it intuitive, like the most important function to run a
scan, ``xrun``:

.. code-block:: python

  xrun(sample-info, scan-info) #run this Sample with this Scan-Plan

To get started, please go to :ref:`quick_start`

If you have suggestions for new features in xpdAcq, or want to report a bug or simply ask a question about
the software, please post it as a new thread at `XPD-Users
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/xpd-users;context-place=overview>`_
